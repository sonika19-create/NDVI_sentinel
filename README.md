# Writing a Python code for calculate NDVI, using Sentinel2 imagery
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used remote sensing index that assesses the health and density of vegetation in a given area. It's calculated from multispectral imagery, typically captured by satellites or drones. NDVI values range from -1 to +1, with higher values indicating healthier and denser vegetation.

NDVI is calculated using the reflectance values from the Red (Red) and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands of the electromagnetic spectrum:

NDVI = NIR−Red/NIR+Red

​Sentinel-2 imagery is commonly used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) due to its specific band configuration, spatial resolution, and frequent revisits. Sentinel-2 offers a range of spatial resolutions, with the highest being 10 meters per pixel. This finer spatial resolution allows for more detailed analysis of vegetation patterns and changes.It is part of the European Space Agency's Copernicus program and is freely available to the public. This accessibility has made Sentinel-2 imagery a popular choice for a wide range of applications, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment.
